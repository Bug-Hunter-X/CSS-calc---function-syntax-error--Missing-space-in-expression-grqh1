The following CSS rule uses a `calc()` function with an invalid expression that results in a syntax error:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

The problem is that it's missing a space between the `100%` and the `-` operator within the `calc()` function, causing the browser's CSS parser to fail.
